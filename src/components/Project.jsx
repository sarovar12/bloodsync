        BloodSync is an INSPIRE Nepal project aimed to solve a critical problem
        in Nepal: Finding blood when in need. Due to certain diseases and
        accidents, patients or their families struggle to find a donor or
        acceptable blood form hospital inventories. BloodSync is a project that
        will be done in collaboration with Human Development and Community
        Service (HDCS), an NGO in Nepal that works in health, education, child
        protection and community development. In the far-western Nepal, HDCS
        manages and runs a community hospital, where the proposed solutions will
        be implemented for the hospital and for the people.
