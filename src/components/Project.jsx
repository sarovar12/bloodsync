          Nepal's per capita income is very low, with more than 70% of Nepalese
          unable to afford private healthcare. Most healthcare facilities are
          concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural regions lagging behind in
          healthcare development. Rukum, situated in one of the most remote and
          rural areas of Nepal, faces significant challenges in healthcare
          access. Human Development and Community Services (HDCS) operates in
          the health sector in Rukum through Chaurjahari Hospital Rukum (CHR).
          Being located in such a remote area with limited access to modern
          medical advancements, the hospital struggles to change people's
          mentality regarding healthcare. The facility's mission extends beyond
          merely treating the sick; it also aims to encourage local residents to
          seek the care they require. Similarly, blood banking is a significant
          challenge in low-income and middle-income countries like Nepal. The
          issue is even more pronounced in rural areas compared to urban
          regions. Rukum district lacks a blood transfusion center, forcing
          patients and their families to search desperately for donors during
          critical times of need. In addition to the stress of medical
          procedures, patients' relatives must also deal with the added burden
          of sourcing blood. This problem deeply affects the livelihoods of
          people in Rukum and nearby regions. The ABCD team from Inspire Nepal
          is determined to collaborate in resolving this critical issue. Our
          team intends to leverage the potential of Information Technology to
          address this problem.

          Human Development and Community Services (HDCS) is a NGO actively
          engaged in various sectors, including health, education, community
          development, and disaster management. As part of its health
          initiative, HDCS is currently collaborating with three hospitals in
          remote areas, one of which is Chaurjahari Hospital Rukum (CHR). CHR is
          strategically located at the convergence of three districts—Rukum,
          Jajarkot, and Salyan—in the mid-western region of Nepal. The primary
          mission of CHR is to provide high-quality and affordable medical
          services to the underprivileged and marginalized communities residing
          in Rukum and the neighboring districts. The hospital not only focuses
          on healthcare provision but also actively engages in community health
          education and endeavors to drive positive social changes. CHR aims to
          deliver efficient healthcare services at minimal costs to residents of
          remote areas, making it one of the most impactful projects in Rukum.
          However, one pressing issue faced by both the hospital and the entire
          Rukum district is the challenge of blood banking. This issue compels
          patients and their families to undergo desperate searches for blood
          donors during critical moments of need.

          In response, our dedicated team,{' '}
          <span className="font-medium text-2xl italic">BloodSync</span>, is
          committed to crafting a technological solution that bridges the divide
          between blood donors and patients. Our primary goal is to devise a
          mechanism that empowers the hospital to efficiently and effectively
          address blood-related issues. Our target audience includes patients in
          remote and underserved areas needing blood transfusions, local
          healthcare providers, Chaurjahari Hospital Rukum (CHR) staff requiring
          timely blood access, and potential blood donors. Our project aims to
          enhance the healthcare system in the region, ensuring quick access to
          life-saving care.
